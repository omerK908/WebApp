Welcome! This file outlines how to set up and run this Angular project, which is provided without the node_modules folder for size and flexibility.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed:
Download and install from https://nodejs.org/ if not already present.
Verify installation by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal.

Steps:

Unzip the project: Extract the received zip file to a desired location on your computer.
Open terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory (where you extracted the files).

Install dependencies:
Use npm to install the required packages:

npm install
 
This will download and install all the necessary dependencies based on the project's package.json file.
Run the project:
Once dependencies are installed, run the development server using:

ng serve

This will start the Angular development server, and the application should be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:4200 (or the port specified in your configuration).
